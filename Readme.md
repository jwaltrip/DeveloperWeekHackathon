> Can run React and Express server in a single command using concurrently

This is just a simple boilerplate to get React and Express working with each other

It does not have MongoDB integration or any DB integration at the moment. This is just an extremely basic startup boilerplate

## Quick Start

``` bash
# Install dependencies for server (Express dependencies)
npm install

# Install dependencies for client (React dependencies)
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```
